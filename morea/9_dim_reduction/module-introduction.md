Dimensionalty reduction is set of techniques for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss.
Dimensionlity reduction is used across disciplines, from IoT to biology. Three of the most popular methods for dimensionality reduction are presented here: PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.
