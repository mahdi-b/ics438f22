    "  A manifold is an extremely important concept in mathematics. In layman’s terms, you can think of it as a surface of any shape. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a plane i.e. it can be shaped like a folded sheet with all the curves. This is generalized to ‘n’ dimensions and formalized as “manifold” in mathematics. If you are interested, you can just google it and read more about it. There are a lot of cool visualizations available on the web.\n",

    "Manifold Learning can be thought of as an attempt to generalize linear frameworks like PCA to be sensitive to non-linear structure in data. Though supervised variants exist, the typical manifold learning problem is unsupervised: it learns the high-dimensional structure of the data from the data itself, without the use of predetermined classifications.\n",
