The Dremio platform, which is the Easy and Open Data Lakehouse Platform, combines some of the concepts covered in class so far. As part of this experience, you will need to complete the [Dremio University](https://university.dremio.com/) "Dremio Fundamentals" (D101) tutorial. It consists mainly of reproducing written instructions for some basic tasks that will help you understand the fundamentals of the Dremio technology.
