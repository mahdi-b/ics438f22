<p>This module discusses key data storage factors, including column
versus row storage and splittability. A discussion of common file
formats is also included in the module.  Additionally, we explain how
large files are processed locally using streaming and introduce the
dataset library that uses Apache Arrow to handle files larger than
what is currently in RAM.</p>
