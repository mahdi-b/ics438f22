A market basket is one of the cornerstones of any analysis of transactional data.  The purpose of this section is to explore two methods for discovering frequent itemsets, which are fundamental for revealing associating between items belonging to the initial subset, as characterized, for example, by a "basket" or a "transaction."

Learn how collaborative filtering works by reading [chapter 6](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch6.pdf) of the Mining Massive Datasets book.
