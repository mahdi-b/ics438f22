## Welcome to ICS 438 / ICS 691 B


The course introduces students to the principles of analytics in big
data with an emphasis on natural language processing and text
analysis. The course syllabus can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_o8-Lsown96PpbDHTh9dLxA9T0Gl_j1pISgJYJXuzE).

#### Overview


Processes for data collection and generation have become easier and
cheaper. For example, a person in a high-income country generates
approximately megabytes of data every second. Despite technological
advances on many fronts, “we are drowning in information, but starving
for knowledge.” Many factors might be contributing to this
situation. Still, perhaps the most relevant is the lack of data-savvy
professionals who can help derive scientific, economic, or social
value from these data.

Data analytics presents various challenges, ranging from ingestion and
management to analysis, visualization, and communication. This course
will cover several big data concepts, with a special emphasis on text
data. Its main objective is to introduce you to practical approaches
and tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets.



### Course Objectives
1. Discover big data platform formats and specifications.
2. Learn fundamental algorithms and techniques to explore big data and generate actionable insights.
3. Getting familiar with machine learning and AI-based models for extracting insight from text data.
