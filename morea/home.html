<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>Processes for data collection and generation have become easier and
cheaper. For example, a person in a high-income country generates
approximately megabytes of data every second. Despite technological
advances on many fronts, “we are drowning in information, but starving
for knowledge.” Many factors might be contributing to this
situation. Still, perhaps the most relevant is the lack of data-savvy
professionals who can help derive scientific, economic, or social
value from these data.</p>

<p>Data analytics presents various challenges, ranging from ingestion and
management to analysis, visualization, and communication. This course
will cover several big data concepts, with a special emphasis on text
data. Its main objective is to introduce you to practical approaches
and tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets.</p>
