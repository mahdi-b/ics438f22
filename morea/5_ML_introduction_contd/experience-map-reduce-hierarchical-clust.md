We discussed in class the basic intuition used behind kmeans++, the algorithm used in Spark K-means with a map-reduce approach. How would you implement hierarchical clustering using map-reduce? For example, given the simple following data output, can you provide a diagram that describes the execution of your proposed approach on the data (a, b, c, d, and e) on two nodes?
