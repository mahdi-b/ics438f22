In addition to text, transformers have been used for a variety of other types of data, such as speech, images, and 
graphs. This notebook provides a  gentle and intuitive introduction to transformers with an emphasis on the 
encoder part that is used to create context-specific embeddings that are ideal to convert text into an analytics-ready resource.

The introduction notebook can be obtained [here](resources/introduction_to_ransformers.ipynb)
